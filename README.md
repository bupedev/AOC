# Advent of Code (AoC)

In 2023, I attempted Advent of Code in F#. It was my first experience with a functional programming language and was
reasonably enjoyable, but I found that learning a new language while participating in Advent of Code was a bit too much.
In 2024, that sentiment is resonating even more strongly as I have two small children at home now. I've decided that I
would like to host my Advent of Code solutions for all years here in the language I use the most (C#).

## Running Solutions

I looked into some previous years of Advent of Code and I noticed that most puzzles require you to write an algorithm
that processes some randomized text. To accomodate this, I have established an C# console application project with
command-line arguments:

```text
Description:
  BupÃ©'s solutions to Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com)

Usage:
  AOC [command] [options]

Options:
  --version       Show version information
  -?, -h, --help  Show help and usage information

Commands:
  ping   Send a request to the server to verify authenticated 
         connection is working correctly.
  solve  Solve the puzzle on a particular year and day.
```

The solve command' uses `System.Reflection` (I know, I am definitely on Santa's naughty list this
year), to select the solution code for each day and year. Each solution is an extension of the `Solution` class which
must provide some key information about the solution (day, year and some functions that return the result of the
solution given some input text).

```csharp
public class DayXXYearYYYY() : Solution(yyyy, xx) {
    protected override object GetPart1Result(string input) {
        return /*solution to part 1*/;
    }

    protected override object GetPart2Result(string input) {
        return /*solution to part 2*/;
    }
}
```

As a test, I have included `D00Example.cs` in the project, which will print information about the input back to the
console:

```text
> .\AOC.exe solve -y 0 -d 0 -t "Hello World!"
Solution for part 1 of day 0 of 0 found in 00:00:00.0003227!

Sample solution for part 1 of day 0 of 0 found in 00:00:00.0002368!

{
  "Lines": [
    "Hello World!"
  ]
}

Sample solution for part 2 of day 0 of 0 found in 00:00:00.0002955!

{
  "CharCount": 12
}
```

For real year/day combinations, the application will also provide the solution using your actual puzzle input. The puzzle inout is automatically fetched from the server providing that a valid session ID is stored in the environment variable named `AOC_SESSION_ID`.

This tool does follow the automation guidelines on the [/r/adventofcode community wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation). Specifically:

 * Outbound calls are throttled to every 2.5 minutes (see `Client.cs`)
 * The `User-Agent` points to this repository on Github (see `Client.cs`)
 * Once inputs are downloaded, they are cached locally in app data (see `PuzzleService.cs`)
